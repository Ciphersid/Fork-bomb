Additional Resources
Python is an extremely popular programming language. Almost, 8.2M developers all over the globe use Python for their projects which is more than Java now. So, in order to master Python language, it is recommended to start by creating some projects.
In this article, we are going to cover Python Project Ideas for beginners and experts with valid source codes.


Top 10 Python Projects for Beginners
Well, if you’ve just started out learning Python or are at a stage where you really want to get your hands dirty, then follow this section. We have discussed a few Python projects with source codes here for you to delve deep and get expertise:

1. Email Slicer
One of the easiest projects to start with is an Email Slicer. The first question that comes to our mind is: what is an email slicer?

In essence, Email Slicer is just a simple tool that will take an email address as input and slice it to produce the username and the domain associated with it. The email must be divided into two strings by using ‘@’ as the separator.

In essence, Email Slicer is just a simple tool that will take an email address as input and slice it to produce the username and the domain associated with it. The email must be divided into two strings by using ‘@’ as the separator.

For example

Input:

InterviewBit@gmail.com
 Output:

Your username is InterviewBit & domain is gmail.com
Here we got InterviewBit as the username and gmail.com as a domain.

Let’s get right to coding and build this quick and easy project. It doesn’t require any setup, so let’s get started!

2. Number to Words
This Python project can make you spell out the numbers you may define. This Python code will help you support more than a million inputs along with non-positive integers like zero, negative integers, or floating numbers. 

You can check the Source Code

3. Google Image downloader
Need a bunch of images for your new project? Then just run this program and download any number of images for a  topic. Only ensure that you do not violate copyright issues and give due credit to the owner if needed.

4. Contact List
As old school as it may sound, creating a contact list, adding contacts along with phone numbers or emails, and editing them, are still prevalent. To create one, you can use the SQLAlchemy library which uses SQLite to store contacts. Your contact book application should be organized into modules and packages, and you should give it a coherent structure.

In order to get the most out of this project, some previous experience with Python and PyQt programming would be helpful. As a result, you will need to know the following:

Develop GUI applications with PyQt and Python
Develop GUI applications with PyQt and Python
Use Python and PyQt to manage SQL databases
Working with SQLite databases
So, In this project, you’ll learn how to:

Implement a GUI for your contact book application with Python and PyQt
Using PyQt’s SQL support to connect the application to an SQLite database 
 Using PyQt’s Model-View architecture for managing contact data
By the end of this project, you’ll have an application that allows you to manage and store your contacts.

5. Monty Hall Simulation Problem
Monty Hall Simulation Problem Python Project
Monty hall’s problem comes from a famous movie where three doors are used to help you win a car. How? Each door hides something behind it–a car and two goats. Any door can have the car while the remaining two have goats. The probability to find a car is ⅓. Now, if you select Door 1 and the host opens Door 3 to find a goat, your chances just become ⅔. This program will help you solve this problem. 

Work Flow and Logic 

The following are the main points of the simulation:

As there are three doors, a random permutation of the numbers 1, 2, and 3 would be generated, with each number representing a door. This permutation contains the first two numbers that correspond to the location of goats behind the door, and the third number corresponds to a car behind the door.
Using images, the configuration is represented graphically. Every configuration has its own image.
Only the door behind which there is a goat is to be revealed after the user has chosen a door number according to the puzzle. By selecting the door behind which the car is parked, the user can then reveal either of the other two doors. If the user selects a door behind which there is a goat, only one of the two remaining doors can be revealed (since the previously selected door cannot be revealed).

6. Image to Sound
You can create sound from image files now. Imagine displaying an image from the forest with the actual forest sound in the background–Just adds to the drama. For this to run, have an image file and sound file (in .mp3 format) ready.

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Speech Synthesis, and then combine them into a single working program.

With one line of code, we can perform optical character recognition using the Python Library pytesseract.

Converting Generated Text to speech
In Python, you can convert speech to text in a variety of ways.
We will use Google Text to Speech to convert our decoded text into audio in this project.

gTTS(Google Text to Speech)
As the following example shows, doing text-to-speech with one line of code is very simple.

>>> from gtts import gTTS
>>> gTTS('Welcome To InterviewBit').save('interviewbit.mp3')
